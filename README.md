# Chess_dashboard: User-customized chess.com data based dashboard using R.

## Background
The inspiration for this project comes from Spotify Wrapped, an event held annually in which the company Spotify, a famous streaming music application, shows its users a summary of its activity throughout the year, which is widely shared on social networks.

So we decided to make a dashboard with this idea but applied it to the world of chess, for which we used the most widely used online chess platform globally, being used both by elite sports celebrities and influencers outside of it.

To make this summary of the user's 2021, we first need to clarify that we will be left with three categories in which the games are classified, according to the time available for each player, bullet (up to 1 minute per player), blitz (between 3 and 5 minutes per player) and rapid (between 10 and 45 minutes per player), so we will really have a dashboard for each one that will only be differentiated by the data shown.

## Steps to follow
In order to generate a dashboard that includes said information, the codes available on this GitHub (**Dashboard.Rmd**) must be executed: an interactive dashboard will be built showing how the user's evolution was throughout the year, distribution of victories, defeats and draws and their causes.
